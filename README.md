# voice-gender-recognition

### Project Description
This project is based around a dataset that I found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/primaryobjects/voicegender). I have been using this dataset mostly to work on my basic data analysis skills through Python and some data science libraries (pandas, sklearn).

For now I have been testing how to get maximum accuracy while keeping the amount of input features down.

### Support Vector Machine Classification
I have been doing classification using the built in Support Vector Machine Classification model in scikit learn, and have been getting roughly 95% accuracy.

### Clustering
As of now, I have been using KMeans clustering from scikit learn to cluster the data into two groups, and the results have indicated that the data groups and the classifications almost match up completely.

### Next Steps
My next approach would be to try at least classification using some form of neural network, where I will most likely use Tensorflow / Keras to do the modelling at first. I am seeing that maybe the data is not extremely nonlinear, large, or complex enough to the point where using neural networks would be necessary, but I do think it will be good practice and a good opportunity to try applying a neural network to data.
